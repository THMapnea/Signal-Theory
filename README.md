# Signal-Theory-

In this repository I am keeping track of my study in signal analysis the first theory chapter from 2->9 are in intalian since that is my language from 10->... they will be in english, the books I followed for the first 9 are Segnali e Sistemi by Francesco Verde and Giacinto Gelli and the second part from chapter 10 until to do is from Li Tan and it is called Digital Signal Processing. The various excercise are not all correct and are the result of my trial and error at least until the file called Esercizi Generali 23 since they were there for studying, from the 24th I will try to post excercise that are fullt correct if possible, this doesnt mean that all the other are wrong but most of them might be imprecise or fundamentally or theoretically wrong so it is always better to check if everything checks before giving by default the excercise made by me to be correct.
